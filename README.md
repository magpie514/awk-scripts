# awk-scripts
Random AWK scripts I developed for fun or to eventually submit to [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code) to fill AWK holes.

## wireworld.awk

Implements a very basic version of the [Wireworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireworld) cellular automaton.
## conwaylife.awk
Implements a very basic version of the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) cellular automaton.
## cards.awk
